### Madhav E-commerce Sales Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes e-commerce performance across states, categories, customers, and payment modes — helping businesses monitor sales, profit, and customer behavior effectively.

### 📌 Overview

This dashboard visualizes online retail data to uncover key insights into sales trends, profitability, and payment preferences.
It combines two datasets — Orders and Details — linked via Order ID for a unified analysis.

Which states or products contribute most to profit?
Which customers generate maximum revenue?
What payment modes or seasons perform best?
Raw transactional data lacks structure and visual clarity for quick decision-making

Tracks and compares performance by region, category, and time.
Provides actionable insights into profitability and customer trends.
Supports data-driven decision-making for marketing and operations teams.
